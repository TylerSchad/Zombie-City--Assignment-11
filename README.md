# Zombie-City--Assignment-11
A project created for Data Structures CSCI 2270, using C++. 
Taking place in a world run over by zombies, where travellers must safely travel between cities.

This project involves being given a provided .txt document, then constructed into a Graph.
From there, the user is given options to find the shortest distance between two locations.
The user can also search for specific vertices, as well as districts (which are properties of each vertice). 
Finally, it involves a Travelling Salesman algorithm to complete a road trip between multiple locations.
